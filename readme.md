# Music genre detection on Arduino

This project classifies music genres on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE using tensorflow lite and convolutional neural networks. Training data is based on the [GTZAN Music Genre Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification) dataset from Kaggle.
